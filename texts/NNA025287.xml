        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly (or via the proxy of an interpreter or other immediate intermediary)
                    from an informant who either lived or grew up as a member of a culture whose
                    primary subsistence at the time of recording was or until recently had been
                    hunting, gathering, and/or fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the
                    recording and the relative freedom from external cultural influences. To create
                    a corpus with high representability, multiple versions of the same narrative
                    were omitted, cultural clusters and close cultural relations between two groups
                    were negatively taken into account, and it was aimed for the highest degree of
                    diversity.</p>

      <p>When <animal>Silver-Fox</animal> left this world, he said to his sweat-house, "Nobody shall ever come in here," and he left a strong wind there to guard the place. No one dares go near this place, for a whirlwind blows up out of it, makes a noise like thunder, and only shamans can go near; but whoever enters is immediately turned to stone inside. <animal>Wolf</animal> and <animal>Silver-Fox</animal> left their power of wind there. <apartmyth>Even now, <animal>wolves</animal> will catch people that come near; and whoever gets inside, turns to <color>white</color> rock.</apartmyth></p>
      <p><pb n="287"/>Once a great shaman dreamed of a <animal>wolf</animal> that was in that sweathouse. He went in. As soon as he got inside, the wind stopped. He went around inside and vomited blood. He said it was an immense sweathouse, as much as a mile across inside. When he came out, he fell down nearly dead. Another shaman cured him. He had seen nothing inside but men turned to stone. Next night this shaman's hair turned as <color>white</color> as snow.</p>

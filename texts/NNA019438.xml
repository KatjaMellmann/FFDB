        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>A man lived at <placeName>Y&#275;&#700;kwin</placeName>. He said that he had come down from above, being the son of the Sun. He had the name <persName>S&#7431;&#700;n&#322;&#275;&#7499;</persName>. Then he wore the sun mask. He came after he had left the place from which he came down, where he had first been. He searched for a house site, looking for a good country. Then he found <placeName>Bar-at-Mouth-of-River</placeName>. There he built a house on the meadow back of the point of <placeName>Bar-at-Mouth-of-River</placeName>. Then he took off his sun mask and he became an ordinary man there.</p>
      <p>Then he paddled and went to <placeName>Bella Bella</placeName>. There he met <persName>Brave</persName>, the Bella Bella. Then he was asked by <persName>Brave</persName>, "[Go on!] [and tell me] how long you have been <pb n="9"/>in the world since the time when you became a man!" Then <persName>S&#7431;&#700;n&#322;&#275;&#7499;</persName> said, "At the same time when the mountains were first put down."</p>
      <p>Then <persName>S&#7431;&#700;n&#322;&#275;&#7499;</persName> also asked <persName>Brave</persName>, "When was the time when you became a man?" - "Behold! I have been a man for a long time," said <persName>Brave</persName>, "I [became a man] at the same time when the kelp was first put down on the water." That is all they said when they parted.</p>
      <p><persName>S&#7431;&#700;n&#322;&#275;&#7499;</persName> went home, and <persName>Brave</persName> went home to where he had come from. <persName>S&#7431;&#700;n&#322;&#275;&#7499;</persName> just went to see the whole world. <epimyth>That is the end.</epimyth></p>

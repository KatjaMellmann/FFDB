        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

He placed traps to catch <animal>fish</animal> in the pools along the stream. He was very lucky and always caught <animal>fish</animal>. One day, <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> went to his <animal>fish</animal> trap and noticed that someone had stolen his <animal>fish</animal>. This happened for many days. <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> then asked the <animal>&#233;tahaha</animal> [a large heron-like marsh <animal>bird</animal>] to watch the trap, but <animal>&#233;tahaha</animal> went to sleep. <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> was angry and as punishment permitted <animal>&#233;tahaha</animal> to eat only <animal>lizards</animal>. <apartmyth>That is why this <animal>bird</animal> eats <animal>lizards</animal> today.</apartmyth> Next <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> ordered the <animal>etoli-toli bird</animal> to watch the trap. He too fell asleep and as punishment the <animal>etoli-toli bird</animal> has had to live thereafter on <animal>locusts</animal>. Finally <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> ordered the <animal>opokon&#243; bird</animal> to fly over his trap all night. At dawn <animal>opokon&#243;</animal> saw some people taking <animal>fish</animal> out of the trap. <animal>Opokon&#243;</animal> then began to cry out and went to <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> to tell him what he had seen. <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> gave <animal>opokon&#243;</animal> a <animal>snail</animal> to eat. <apartmyth>That is why <animal>opokon&#243;</animal> keeps crying and eating <animal>snails</animal> today.</apartmyth></p>
      <p>Then <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> got up, put on his sandals and with his two <animal>dogs</animal> went to the trap. The <animal>dogs</animal> took up the trail of the thieves and followed the tracks to a hole in the ground. <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> took away the leaves covering the hole and found that it was full of people. He then pulled out all the people. He pulled out the Brazilians, Paraguayans, and all other nations. To the Terena he gave land and told them how to grow <plant>crops</plant>. He almost forgot the Caduveo and pulled them out last and told them to wait while he was giving the other people land. But the Caduveo ran off to hunt. <persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> was angry and said, "Now you must always wander about looking for <animal>animals</animal> to hunt." <apartmyth>That is why the Caduveo are still poor hunters.</apartmyth></p>
      <p><persName>Ono&#233;-noe</persName> then evacuated and from his excrement came the Chamacoco, <epimyth>"That is why the Chamacoco are such stupid and dirty people."</epimyth></p>

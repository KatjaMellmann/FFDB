        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Some <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> lived in a sweat-house near where <animal>Bluejay</animal> and <animal>Lizard</animal> lived. These latter had all kinds of food stored in bags of tule. The <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> had only <plant>acorns</plant>, and used to have to go to the other house to get <animal>salmon</animal> and meat. A <animal>Grizzly-Bear</animal> went over at sundown and sat down, saying, "I was sent over for scraps;" then <animal>Bluejay</animal> would say, "All right, get out some <animal>salmon</animal>," and <animal>Lizard</animal> would give <animal>Grizzly-Bear</animal> a large pile of it. When he got back home, the others would say, "They always give us a lot." In the morning another <animal>Grizzly</animal> went, and came back with a huge basket of <plant>pine</plant>-nuts; and in the evening then another would go, to get a lot of <plant>sunflower</plant>-seeds. In this way <animal>Bluejay</animal> and <animal>Lizard</animal> gave away all the food they had, and began to get hungry. <animal>Lizard</animal>, however, had been afraid that this would happen, so he had hidden ten <animal>salmon</animal> under his pillow while <animal>Bluejay</animal> had gone after wood one day. When all the rest of the food was gone, <animal>Lizard</animal> produced this reserve supply, and the two lived on this for a time. The <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> had saved much of the food they had begged, and feasted while the others were starving. The <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> hoped the others would die.</p>
      <p><animal>Bluejay</animal> soon got very weak, but <animal>Lizard</animal> was still able to get about. One day <animal>Lizard</animal> covered up the coals with ashes in their house, closed the smoke-hole, and, taking his knife, crept over to the house where the <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> were, all asleep. <animal>Lizard</animal> looked in and saw all the food they had there in storage. Then he went into the house, picked out the <pb n="169"/>largest <animal>Grizzly-Bear</animal>, crawled into his anus, and cut out his heart. He brought the heart out, then skinned the body of the <animal>bear</animal>, the others meanwhile sleeping on. <animal>Lizard</animal> baked the liver quickly in the ashes, and ate it, then, leaning a pole up against the door, he walked on this, so that the <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> could not see his tracks. He took all the <animal>Grizzly-Bear</animal> meat home with him, and one basket of <plant>acorns</plant>. He found <animal>Bluejay</animal> almost dead; but he cooked some meat, and gave him some, and, after getting a little stronger, he was able to eat a great deal; and the two ate nearly all night.</p>
      <p>In the morning the <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> woke up, and missed one of their number, but thought he had merely gone out of the house for a time. So they were not worried, but built a fire and sweated. <animal>Lizard</animal> and <animal>Bluejay</animal> kept quiet in their house, and did not move out. Every night <animal>Lizard</animal> did the same thing, killing one of the <animal>Bears</animal> until he had killed four of them, - two on each side of the door as they slept. The <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> did not suspect what the trouble was, for they thought both <animal>Lizard</animal> and <animal>Bluejay</animal> were dead. Thus <animal>Lizard</animal> and <animal>Bluejay</animal> lived through the winter.</p>
